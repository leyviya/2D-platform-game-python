# 2D-platform-game-python
In this project we’ll look at how we can use Python to create a 2D game. To solve this we would use PyGame which makes it easy to both understand the very basics of game programming and python. At the end of this project we will have a playable breakout game that we’ve written from start to stop using Python together with PyGame.
